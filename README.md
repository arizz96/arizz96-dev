# A delightful representation of my portfolio
This simple repository contains my personal website created with a simple [json viewer library](https://github.com/abodelot/jquery.json-viewer) to render a funny (and nerdy) portfolio about me.

Check out [arizz96.dev](https://www.arizz96.dev/) to see it in action!
