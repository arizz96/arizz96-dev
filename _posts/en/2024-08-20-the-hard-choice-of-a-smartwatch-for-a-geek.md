## The hard choice of a smartwatch for a geek

The mental journey of a techtusiast choosing among smartwatches.

## Starting point

Let’s start with the fact that I hardly wore a bracelet or watch in the first 20 years of my life. However, I randomly encountered an amazing piece of tech that stole my heart.

### Pebble Time Round
>  A tear always falls when I think about it.

It was the summer of 2017 when I bought the **Pebble Time Round**, 20mm size. I don’t exactly remember how I discovered this smartwatch, but for about 90€, it was an amazing tool.

I’m really passionate about anything tech-related, and wearing a watch that could do more than just display the time was a big yes for me!

The interface was polished and very clean. The design was awesome, with a 7.5mm thickness and a minimalistic style. I simply loved it. My favorite watch face was [Minimalin](https://github.com/GringerApps/minimalin) because I love minimalism.

One of the top apps I used was NavMe, which provides Google’s turn-by-turn navigation on your wrist. In my life, I rarely bought apps because I always found free alternatives, but this one was definitely worth it!

I used the past tense for the descriptions above because, in December 2016, Pebble officially announced that the company would shut down (yes, that was even before I ordered my Time Round, which probably explains why it was so cheap).

Later that year, I gifted the Pebble 2 HR to my brother. It featured a heart rate sensor, and I thought it was perfect for a sportsman like him.

### Apple Watch

I graduated in October 2018, and my friends gifted me an **Apple Watch series 4** (which I thank them for once again — especially Nicola, who called and visited many stores to get it on time).

It’s an amazing device (I’m still using it), and it fits perfectly within the Apple ecosystem: I never miss a notification, can take calls directly from the watch, track my activity, get step-by-step directions, and so on.

Having a smartwatch became a priority when my responsibilities at work increased. I wanted to always be notified if a colleague needed help or if alerts popped up.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I’m not used to wearing accessories, and this watch is thicker than the Pebble and squared, not round. These are not complaints, just the two major differences I’ve noticed.

## Future

This little friend of mine has been helping me on a daily basis for nearly six years and accompanies me around the world when I go hiking. But the battery is now struggling to last a single day (battery health is around 60%).

I’m now thinking about the successor to my watch. Will it be a brand-new Apple Watch or something else?

I have a few requirements for it:

* 1+ day battery life

* displaying the time

* iPhone notifications mirroring

* activity tracking (mainly for GPS track recording)

The Apple Watch is an easy choice, an instant replacement without needing to learn something new…

…but I’m not one for easy things, and I’m always searching for new tools to test, especially when it comes to tech.

The **CMF Watch Pro by Nothing** is a good alternative — it does everything I need at a very low price.

### **Hackable smartwatches**

While looking for alternatives, I found some open-source smartwatches that inevitably caught my attention as a geek:

* **Bangle.js 2**: a squared watch that’s completely open-source, with easy development using JavaScript and their custom libraries.

* **PineTime**: another open-source smartwatch that lacks GPS but is worth mentioning.

* **Watchy**: a DIY e-paper smartwatch, but a bit too hacky for me to use as a daily driver.

It’s a hard choice out there. I’m still undecided but eager to see what the new Apple Watch will look like and what features it will bring.
I hope I can resist the temptation of the Bangle.js 2 until the Apple Watch announcement date!

Stay tuned, and please comment with any other alternatives if you know of any!
