Backend Engineer with a passion for simple, elegant and proof APIs. I write clean, scalable code with full test coverage. Develop, maintain and expand high-traffic web applications.

I am passionate about technology, with sound background in problem solving. Its not always about any solution but the right solution for a problem. I am a fast learner and like to work on new challenges.

I always think of new ideas and optimized solution to different challenges. I am very pro-active and often go out of my way to take up tasks that I consider could help the health of the project or contribute to the company.
